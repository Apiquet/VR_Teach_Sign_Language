C# project using the awesome VR and Leap Motion technologies to build a game to learn sign language.


# The project

My main goal, through this project, was to build a game to help people learning sign language. Thanks to the leap motion technology which works good nowadays, I can precisely evaluate the player’s gesture. 
Then, I needed to build a dataset of signs, easily accessible (by its name) and containing enough attributes to properly evaluate the player’s sign. A system of score had to be displayed based on this comparison.
